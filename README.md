# ðŸ”Œ Energy Predictor LSTM

End-to-end AI system that predicts hourly energy consumption of a smart building using LSTM.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project builds a time-series forecasting model using LSTM neural networks to predict energy consumption based on past appliance usage data. The system simulates how smart buildings can optimize their energy management.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸ”„ Pipeline

1. Load and clean time-series data
2. Normalize and sequence for LSTM input
3. Train the LSTM model
4. Generate predictions and visualize results
5. Save model for edge deployment (`.h5`)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
